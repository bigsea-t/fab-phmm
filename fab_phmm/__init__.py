fab_phmm

fab_phmm is a Python implementation of Pairwise Hidden Markov Models (PHMMs)
and its extension with a model selection capability, FAB-PHMM.
FAB-PHMM utilize Factorized Information Criteria (FIC), a type of Information Criteria,
which is similar to Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) but more suitable for
latent variable models such as HMMs.

For more information about FIC, refer the ICML 2014 proceeding
"Factorized Asymptotic Bayesian Hidden Markov Models" by Fujimaki et al.
